Employee Class #2

Create a class called Employee that includes three instance variables — a first name (type String), a last name
(type String) and a monthly salary (type double). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance
variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it
to 0.0. Write a test app named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two
Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display
each Employee’s yearly salary again.
