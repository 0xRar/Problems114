Employee Class #1

Write a class named Employee that has the following fields:
  • The name field is a String object that holds the employee’s name.
  • The idNumber is an int variable that holds the employee’s ID number.
  • The department field is a String object that holds the name of the department where the employee works.
  • The position field is a String object that holds the employee’s job title.
  
Write appropriate set methods that store values in these fields and get methods that return the values in these
fields. Once you have written the class, write a separate program that creates three Employee objects to hold
the following data.
